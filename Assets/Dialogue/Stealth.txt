0 NPC: Ruby?
S T0ast3r: Ruby has been rendered unconscious. 
W T0ast3r: I recommend proceeding further into the base to ensure your safety.
0 NPC: Where's Ruby? Is she gonna be ok? I need to help her!
S T0ast3r: Her mech has collapsed onto the base. You will not be able to reach it from here.
N T0ast3r: If you want to help, go to the link center.
0 NPC: A link what?
N T0ast3r: All pilots have a neural link to their mech for better control. 
N T0ast3r: You may be able to link yourself to her and force her awake. 
0 NPC:Something about that sounds... dangerous
A T0ast3r: It is the only option you have, if you leave her, you will both die.

0 NPC: Fine I’ll give it a shot I guess. 
N T0ast3r: Good choice NPC. Now proceed through the door down the hall to the right.
W T0ast3r: Be careful. Without Ruby to fight the monster, it will be looking for you. 
W T0ast3r: Its eyes have a distinct glow, try to avoid strange lights. 
0 NPC: Oh fun now it wants to eat me, loving that.
N T0ast3r: I am unsure if the monster will eat you, it's more likely to-.
0 NPC: AH no please don't say anything else... just wish me luck.
C T0ast3r: I would, but you do not appear to be ‘Lucky’.
