N NPC: Wait… is everything ok?
A Ruby: Get inside, quick! We’re going down!
S NPC: Going down?!?! 
N NPC: ...
N NPC: Ruby?
S T0ast3r: Lieutenant Ruby has been rendered unconscious. 
S T0ast3r: Her mech has collapsed onto the base.
N T0ast3r: I recommend proceeding further into the base and searching for the LEO. 
N T0ast3r: It might still be functional for take off. 
S NPC: But what about Ruby? I can’t just leave her here!
A T0ast3r: ...Alright, if you wish to help Lieutenant Ruby, go to the link center.
N T0ast3r: All pilots have a neural link to their mech to facilitate movement. 
N T0ast3r: You can awaken a pilot by reactivating the link to her mech.
N NPC: ...
N NPC: ...
S NPC: Fine I’ll give it a shot I guess. 
N T0ast3r: Proceed through the door down the hall to the right.
W T0ast3r: Be careful. Without Ruby to fight the monster, it will be looking for you. 
W T0ast3r: Its eyes have a distinct glow, try to avoid strange lights. 
S NPC: Oh fun, now it wants to eat me, loving that.
N T0ast3r: I am unsure if the monster will eat you, it's more likely to-.
S NPC: AH no please don't say anything else... just wish me luck.
C T0ast3r: I would, but you do not appear to be ‘lucky’.
