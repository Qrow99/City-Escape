N Ruby: NPC, have you reached the lobby?
E NCP: Yeah, I just got down here. Is something wrong? 
N Ruby: I bought us some time to brief you on the LEO. 
W T0ast3r: Ruby, do you think he can handle the Low-Earth Orbit shuttle? 
E NPC: Low...
N NPC: Earth...
S NPC: Orbit? 
N T0ast3r: It is a military craft that can ascend to the upper atmosphere. 
N T0ast3r: Normally, there is a training program required to handle the g-forces. 
N T0ast3r: Due to our unusual situation, you will be using one to leave Neo-Venice.
C T0ast3r: There is a 70% chance of successful lift off.
W T0ast3r: There is a 30% chance of incineration upon atmospheric re-entry.
N NPC: ...Oh, neat.
N Ruby: What? Afraid of a couple of g’s? 
S NPC: I mean I don’t want to burn to death!
P Ruby: Oh you’ll be fine. This hospital is on a military base, 
N Ruby: so the LEO is located in the basement.
N Ruby: The orbital strike isn't even happening for a few hours. 
S NPC: Wait, orbital strike?!?
N Ruby: I can't kill this thing as is, and we can't let it leave the city, so yes. 
P Ruby: It's out of my hands, the higher ups made the call.
N Ruby: It’s a kinetic launch, no payload. We don’t need to worry about fallout.
A Ruby: But it will wipe this city off the map. So get moving!
