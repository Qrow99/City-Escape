P Ruby: Hey Toast, buddy, uh why is the MAC cannon pointing at me? 
W T0ast3r: Nate is going to fire it so you have time to join us on the LEO.
W T0ast3r: We are going to use your mech to help aim.
A Ruby: What!? But this is MY fight and I’ve gotta finish it!
S Nate: Ruby look, I lied, I saw everything. 
S Nate: I didn’t know your team, but I don't think they’d want you to die for revenge.
S Nate: Now get out of the robot so we can get out of here!
0 Ruby: ...
N Nate: Ruby?
A Ruby: Ok, fine! I’m on the way. I’ll see you there.
E Nate: Good! And when we get somewhere safe, I’ll buy you a drink! 
S Nate: Toast, are we ready to fire?
N T0ast3r: Almost, once Ruby enters a safe distance, I will fire. 
N T0ast3r: Her mech has latched itself to the monster’s tail.
A T0ast3r: The cannon is almost guaranteed to hit the monster.
W T0ast3r: However, until I fire, the monster will be looking for you and Ruby.

P Ruby: What took ya so long NPC?
S Nate: Oh c’mon I'm about to save your life! Could you at least call me Nate?
N Ruby: Roger that NPC.
S Nate: Ugh why did I save you.

C T0ast3r: That did it! Cannon is Charging.
E Nate: Oh that thing was the battery? I was just moving it.
E Nate: I mean uh... Fire when ready Toast!
